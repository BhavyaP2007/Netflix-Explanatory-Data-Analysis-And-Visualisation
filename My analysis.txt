My analysis :

1. Content availability is higher on Netflix released in the last 10 years as compared to the period before that.
2. Earlier, very less TV shows were produced as compared to movies. Over the years, more number of TV shows are being produced as compared to movies.
3. Actors like Anupam Kher, Shah Rukh Khan, Julie Tejwani etc can be seen very frequently in different movies and shows.
4. Dramas and comedies have been the top genres.
5. Dramas, thrillers and action-packed movies are usually longer in duration than horror movies and movies for children.
6. Earlier, the duration of movies was quite high exceeding 3 hours which has now dropped to 110 minutes.
